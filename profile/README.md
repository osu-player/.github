Hey there my name is Founntain!
A bit about myself. I'm currently `currentYear - 1999` years old and from Germany. 
Currently I'm working for a medium sized software developing company as Software Consultant.

**Languages I use:**
+ C# *(For most of my projects)*
+ HTML, CSS and Typescript *(for web stuff)*
+ Java *(mostly for Minecraft plugin development)*

In 2016 I had my first programming contact in my IT-School. There we mostly developed in Java, but all stuff that we programmed in Java I tried to implement in C#
while learning it on my own.  

In 2017 I started development on the first versions of the osu!player in WPF and .NET-Framework 4.6. It looked bad, it feeled bad and had bad performance.
But let's be honest what do expect from someone who never used WPF at all and had not much C# experience. 
On 1st of November 2017, the first version of the osu!player was released on the osu! forum.  

After a while Cesan joined me and we started working on it together until now and I'm really greatful for that. *Thanks buddy*
